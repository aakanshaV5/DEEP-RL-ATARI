# DEEP-RL-ATARI

This project uses deep RL to train an agent that can play Atari game named Space Invaders.

Deep Reinforcement Learning
With deep reinforcement learning, we use deep neural networks to estimate the q-values that are used to take an action (used in policy). In many practical decision making problems, the states s of the MDP are high-dimensional (eg. images from a camera or the raw sensor stream from a robot) and cannot be solved by traditional RL algorithms. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms incorporate deep learning to solve such Maps a, often representing the policy Ï€ ( a | s ) or other learned functions as a neural network, and developing specialized algorithms that perform well in this setting.
